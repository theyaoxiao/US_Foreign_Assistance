[["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values After performing data cleaning in Chapter 3, the dataset we will use has a total of 263,053 rows and 16 features of interest. As is summarized in Table 4.1 which computes the number of missing values for each variable, we see that data are missing only in two specific fields: Activity.Start.Date and Activity.End.Date. These two refer to the start and end dates of different US foreign aids program activities. These may cause issues that hinder our understanding of the time pattern of the data. For example, with a majority of the dataset missing these two variables, it may be hard to generalize an expected duration of the program activities. For our purposes, in the final analysis, we choose not to include these two columns. However, since none of the year column contains missing data, we can still surmise the approximate time frame of each activity implemented. Table 4.1: Number of Rows Missing by Variable variable_name NA_rows_count Activity.End.Date 217358 Activity.Start.Date 203816 Also, we can take a closer look at the missingness pattern and observe for which combination of attributes, missing data are the most common. According to the results outlined in Table 4.2, observations that are missing both Activity.Start.Date and Activity.End.Date are the most dominant. Observations that do not have data for either Activity.Start.Date or Activity.End.Date come second. Noticeably, observations with data on Activity.Start.Date are significantly more than those with data on Activity.End.Date. This may indicate that the US government implements their foreign aid program activities that often do not have designated end dates. Table 4.2: Number of Rows with a Specified Missing Pattern Activity.Start.Date Activity.End.Date Other.Variables NA_rows_count TRUE TRUE FALSE 201564 FALSE FALSE FALSE 43443 FALSE TRUE FALSE 15794 TRUE FALSE FALSE 2252 To visualize the missingness pattern in juxtaposition with the number of missing rows for each column already mentioned and interpreted from the above summary tables, the following graph provides further details on the proportion of rows that are missing. We observe that around 80% of the data contain missing values for one or both of Activity.Start.Date and Activity.End.Date. More specifically, rows contain missing values for both of Activity.Start.Date and Activity.End.Date account for 76.6% of the dataset, and rows that have no missing values account for 16.3% of the dataset. 6.3% of data are rows that do not have values for Activity.End.Date, and 0.9% of data do not have values for Activity.Start.Date.
